Before we install Node.js, let's check if Homebrew, a popular package manager, is installed on your system. Type the following command and hit Enter:

```bash
brew -v
If Homebrew is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the official Homebrew website.

**Step 1: Install Node.js using Homebrew**
Now, let's install Node.js using Homebrew. In your Terminal, run the following command:

brew install node
This will download and install the latest version of Node.js along with npm, the Node.js package manager.

**Step 2: Verify the Installation**
To verify that Node.js and npm were installed successfully, type the following commands:

node -v
npm -v

**Installing vue cli**
The first step is to install the Vue CLI. Open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
This will install the Vue CLI globally on your machine. Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by checking the version:
vue --version
If you see a version number, you're good to go!


**Step 2: Create a New Vue Project**
[Slide: Step 2 - Create a New Vue Project]

Now that we have the Vue CLI installed, let's create a new Vue 3 project. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

vue create my-vue-project
Replace "my-vue-project" with the desired name for your project. The CLI will prompt you to pick a preset - choose the default preset for this tutorial.

Once the project is created, navigate into the project folder:

cd my-vue-project


**Step 3: Explore Project Structure**
[Slide: Step 3 - Explore Project Structure]

Let's take a quick look at the project structure. Open the project in your preferred code editor. You'll see various folders and files. The 'src' folder is where most of your application code will reside.

Feel free to explore the files, but for now, let's move on to the next step.


**Step 4: Run the Vue Project**
[Slide: Step 4 - Run the Vue Project]

To see your Vue app in action, run the following command:

npm run serve
This will start a development server, and you can access your app in the browser at the provided URL. Make changes to the code, and the browser will automatically update.

Congratulations! You've successfully created and run your Vue 3 project using the CLI.




**Integrating tailwind css**
Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies using npm or yarn. In this example, I'll use npm:

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
Create Tailwind CSS Configuration Files:
Run the following command to create a tailwind.config.js file:

npx tailwindcss init -p
This will create the configuration file and open it in your default text editor.

Configure PostCSS:
Create a postcss.config.js file in your project root with the following content:

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
Create a CSS Entry Point:
Create a new CSS file, for example, src/assets/css/tailwind.css, and import Tailwind CSS in it:

/* src/assets/css/tailwind.css */
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
Import Tailwind CSS in Your Main JavaScript File:
Open your main JavaScript file (usually src/main.js) and import the Tailwind CSS file:

// src/main.js
import 'path-to-your-css-file/tailwind.css';
Add Scripts to Your package.json:
Add the following scripts to your package.json file:

"scripts": {
  "build:css": "postcss src/assets/css/tailwind.css -o src/assets/css/tailwind.output.css",
  "watch:css": "postcss src/assets/css/tailwind.css -o src/assets/css/tailwind.output.css -w",
  "serve": "vue-cli-service serve"
}
Replace src/assets/css/tailwind.css with the correct path if you used a different one.
